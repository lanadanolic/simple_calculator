I created a simple calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application is user-friendly and allows basic arithmetic operations, making it a practical and lightweight tool for quick calculations.

Features of the Calculator:
Basic Operations:

Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Users can input numbers and perform calculations just like on a physical calculator.
Interactive User Interface:

Buttons for numbers (0–9) and arithmetic operators (+, -, ×, ÷).
A "clear" button to reset the calculation.
A display screen to show the input and result.
Responsive Design:

Styled using CSS for a clean and modern look.
Fully responsive, so it works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
JavaScript Logic:

Handles button clicks and performs calculations dynamically.
Validates inputs to ensure proper functionality (e.g., no division by zero).
Updates the display in real-time as users interact with the calculator.
